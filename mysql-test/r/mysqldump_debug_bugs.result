CREATE DATABASE test_bug36248967;
-- Run mysqldump with payload injected to server version.
A warning must be issued.
-- Warning: version string returned by server is incorrect.
Warning: A partial dump from a server that has GTIDs will by default include the GTIDs of all transactions, even those that changed suppressed parts of the database. If you don't want to restore GTIDs, pass --set-gtid-purged=OFF. To make a complete dump, pass --all-databases --triggers --routines --events. 
Warning: A dump from a server that has GTIDs enabled will by default include the GTIDs of all transactions, even those that were executed during its extraction and might not be represented in the dumped data. This might result in an inconsistent data dump. 
In order to ensure a consistent backup of the database, pass --single-transaction or --lock-all-tables or --source-data. 
The test version must be found:

The test injected string must not be found:
