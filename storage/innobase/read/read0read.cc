-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACT A: Cursor read view on a secondary index sees only committed versions
-------
of the records in the secondary index or those versions of rows created
by transaction which created a cursor before cursor was created even
if transaction which created the cursor has changed that clustered index page.

PROOF: We must show that read goes always to the clustered index record
to see that record is visible in the cursor read view. Consider e.g.
following table and SQL-clauses:

create table t1(a int not null, b int, primary key(a), index(b));
insert into t1 values (1,1),(2,2);
commit;

Now consider that we have a cursor for a query

select b from t1 where b >= 1;

This query will use secondary key on the table t1. Now after the first fetch
on this cursor if we do a update:

update t1 set b = 5 where b = 2;

Now second fetch of the cursor should not see record (2,5) instead it should
see record (2,2).

We also should show that if we have delete t1 where b = 5; we still
can see record (2,2).

When we access a secondary key record maximum transaction id is fetched
from this record and this trx_id is compared to up_limit_id in the view.
If trx_id in the record is greater or equal than up_limit_id in the view
cluster record is accessed.  Because trx_id of the creating
transaction is stored when this view was created to the list of
trx_ids not seen by this read view previous version of the
record is requested to be built. This is build using clustered record.
If the secondary key record is delete-marked, its corresponding
clustered record can be already be purged only if records
trx_id < low_limit_no. Purge can't remove any record deleted by a
transaction which was active when cursor was created. But, we still
may have a deleted secondary key record but no clustered record. But,
this is not a problem because this case is handled in
row_sel_get_clust_rec() function which is called
whenever we note that this read view does not see trx_id in the
record. Thus, we see correct version. Q. E. D.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACT B: Cursor read view on a clustered index sees only committed versions
-------
of the records in the clustered index or those versions of rows created
by transaction which created a cursor before cursor was created even
if transaction which created the cursor has changed that clustered index page.

PROOF:  Consider e.g.following table and SQL-clauses:

create table t1(a int not null, b int, primary key(a));
insert into t1 values (1),(2);
commit;

Now consider that we have a cursor for a query

select a from t1 where a >= 1;

This query will use clustered key on the table t1. Now after the first fetch
on this cursor if we do a update:

update t1 set a = 5 where a = 2;

Now second fetch of the cursor should not see record (5) instead it should
see record (2).

We also should show that if we have execute delete t1 where a = 5; after
the cursor is opened we still can see record (2).

When accessing clustered record we always check if this read view sees
trx_id stored to clustered record. By default we don't see any changes
if record trx_id >= low_limit_id i.e. change was made transaction
which started after transaction which created the cursor. If row
was changed by the future transaction a previous version of the
clustered record is created. Thus we see only committed version in
this case. We see all changes made by committed transactions i.e.
record trx_id < up_limit_id. In this case we don't need to do anything,
we already see correct version of the record. We don't see any changes
made by active transaction except creating transaction. We have stored
trx_id of creating transaction to list of trx_ids when this view was
created. Thus we can easily see if this record was changed by the
creating transaction. Because we already have clustered record we can
access roll_ptr. Using this roll_ptr we can fetch undo record.
We can now check that undo_no of the undo record is less than undo_no of the
trancaction which created a view when cursor was created. We see this
clustered record only in case when record undo_no is less than undo_no
in the view. If this is not true we build based on undo_rec previous
version of the record. This record is found because purge can't remove
records accessed by active transaction. Thus we see correct version. Q. E. D.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
FACT C: Purge does not remove any delete-marked row that is visible
-------
in any cursor read view.

PROOF: We know that:
 1: Currently active read views in trx_sys_t::view_list are ordered by
    ReadView::low_limit_no in descending order, that is,
    newest read view first.

 2: Purge clones the oldest read view and uses that to determine whether there
    are any active transactions that can see the to be purged records.

Therefore any joining or active transaction will not have a view older
than the purge view, according to 1.

When purge needs to remove a delete-marked row from a secondary index,
it will first check that the DB_TRX_ID value of the corresponding
record in the clustered index is older than the purge view. It will
also check if there is a newer version of the row (clustered index
record) that is not delete-marked in the secondary index. If such a
row exists and is collation-equal to the delete-marked secondary index
record then purge will not remove the secondary index record.

Delete-marked clustered index records will be removed by
row_purge_remove_clust_if_poss(), unless the clustered index record
(and its DB_ROLL_PTR) has been updated. Every new version of the
clustered index record will update DB_ROLL_PTR, pointing to a new UNDO
log entry that allows the old version to be reconstructed. The
DB_ROLL_PTR in the oldest remaining version in the old-version chain
may be pointing to garbage (an undo log record discarded by purge),
but it will never be dereferenced, because the purge view is older
than any active transaction.

For details see: row_vers_old_has_index_entry() and row_purge_poss_sec()

Some additional issues:

What if trx_sys->view_list == NULL and some transaction T1 and Purge both
try to open read_view at same time. Only one can acquire trx_sys->mutex.
In which order will the views be opened? Should it matter? If no, why?

The order does not matter. No new transactions can be created and no running
RW transaction can commit or rollback (or free views). AC-NL-RO transactions
will mark their views as closed but not actually free their views.

        * bumping trx_sys->next_trx_id_or_no for assignment to trx->no, and
          adding it to serialization_list happens without trx_sys->mutex - it
          uses trx_sys->serialization mutex instead, and is sequenced-before
          removing he trx->id from trx_sys->rw_trx_ids
        * the purge coordinator doesn't acquire trx_sys->serialization_mutex
        * the purge coordinator might create an "artificial" view if it could
          not find any suitable open view in the list
        * two views can have same m_low_limit_no, yet represent different sets
          of committed transactions
        * two views can represent the same set of committed transactions, but
          differ in m_low_limit_no

    Let's define "V1 is-subset-of V2" to mean that the set of transaction IDs
    that V1 considers visible/committed, is a subset of those for V2.
    (In particular, if a given natural number is used as NO, instead of ID, then
    the answer for this number doesn't influence the is-subset-of relation.)

    We need following properties:

    P1. If we decide to reopen the view, then if someone at any moment observes
    that "purge_sys->view is-subset-of the view" doesn't hold, then the
    observation must have happened-after the view became closed again.

    P2. If any observation of purge_sys->view == V1 happens-before
    an observation of purge_sys->view == V2, then V1 is-subset-of V2.

    The P1 is needed, so that we don't crash when using this view when trying to
    restore older version of a record by traversing undo log chains.

    The P2 is definitely helpful to traverse undo chains "until trx seen by V2",
    without having to worry about undo log record being already purged when
    purge_sys->view was V1. We also need P2 in the rollback logic to properly
    decide if the record should be physically removed by the transaction thread
    as no longer needed or should it be deleted later lazily by purge thread -
    a wrong decision here can lead to a leak or a crash.

    We achieve P2 "trivially" in purge coordinator logic of clone_oldest_view(),
    by simply refusing to change purge_sys->view to a view which has smaller
    or equal m_low_limit_no, which ensures that V2 must have strictly larger
    m_low_limit_no than V1. Because m_low_limit_no values are assigned a value
    loaded from trx_sys->serialisation_min_trx_no which we know to be
    non-decreasing in time, and load and assignment happen under trx_sys->mutex,
    it follows the assignment to V2->m_low_limit_no happened-after the one for
    V1. The m_ids is also initialized by copying trx_sys->rw_trx_ids inside same
    critical section protected by trx_sys->mutex, so it follows that V1 copied
    an older state of trx_sys->rw_trx_ids than V2, and thus V1 is-subset-of V2,
    as needed.

    The proof that P1 holds works only if we pretend that instead of non-atomic
    view->m_closed = false, we have view->m_closed.store(false, seq_cst). Later,
    we will show why in practice it works with non-atomic variable and no memory
    barrier.

    The proof is by contradiction:
    Assume that someone sees "purge_sys->view is-subset-of the view" doesn't
    hold and we did reopen. This means purge_sys->view can see an ID which view
    can't. Observers of purge_sys->view hold purge_sys->latch, so this
    observation had to happened-after the purge coordinator has set the
    purge_sys->view, which it does while x-latching the purge_sys->latch, which
    means such assignments are well ordered, so lets focus on the oldest such
    assignment which violated "purge_sys->view is-subset-of the view" for the
    first time. Let's call the purge_sys->view assigned then V2, and the one
    before it V1. The purge coordinator assigns purge_sys->view under
    trx_sys->mutex, and removing ID from trx_sys->rw_trx_ids is done under
    this mutex, so it had to happen-before V2 was constructed if V2 can see
    ID. This means trx_sys->next_trx_id_or_no was already > ID before purge
    coordinator started iterating the trx_sys->mvcc->m_views list. Our view can
    not see ID, and view->empty() == true, so view->m_low_limit_id <= ID. As we
    assumed we will reopen it means we saw trx_sys->next_trx_id_or_no ==
    view->m_low_limit_id, so <= ID, which implies the `S-order` relation between
    our load() and fetch_add() in the following timeline:

    view->m_closed = false `sequenced-before`
    trx_sys->next_trx_id_or_no.load() == view->m_low_limit_id `S-ordered-before`
    ID=trx_sys->next_trx_id_or_no.fetch_add() `sequenced-before`
    trx_sys->mutex.exit() in commit of ID `happens-before`
    trx_sys->mutex.enter() of purge coordinator `sequenced-before`
    purge coordinator reads view->m_closed `sequenced-before`
    purge coordinator selects purge_sys->view which sees ID.

    If accesses to view->m_closed were std::memory_order_seq_cst, then the first
    `sequenced-before` becomes `S-ordered-before` and `S-order` must be
    consistent with `happens-before` and modification order of view->m_closed,
    so to avoid a cycle it has to be that purge coordinator sees either the
    false stored by us to view->m_closed, or some later store, which could
    happen if we closed it again. But, seeing view->m_closed == false, the
    purge coordinator should either select our view as V2, or keep the old V1,
    both of which contradict definition of V2 as first such that it sees ID.

    Above proof relies on the assumption that view->m_closed=false becomes
    visible to purge coordinator before we load next_trx_id_or_no. For,
    consider:
    1. putting m_closed = false in store buffer, but not flushing it yet
    2. seeing trx_sys->next_trx_id_or_no == view->m_low_limit_id
    3. another thread doing ID=trx_sys->next_trx_id_or_no.fetch_add(), adding
       ID to trx_sys->rw_trx_ids, then commits, removing ID from
       trx_sys->rw_trx_ids under trx_sys->mutex
    4. purge coordinator acquires trx_sys->mutex released by trx from step 3
    5. purge coordinator still does not see our m_closed=false and thus
       selects a purge_sys->view which sees ID
    This was never seen to happen in practice - probably because x64 CPUs keep
    writing from store buffer ASAP and context-switch is a memory barrier, uet
    somehow whole step 3 has to happen before store gets published. Moreover, to
    really cause a crash the transaction has to produce undo logs. */
