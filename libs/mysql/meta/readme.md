MySQL Library: Meta
===================
-->

Code documentation: @ref GroupLibsMysqlMeta.

## Overview

This library contains generic features related to meta-programming, i.e.,
algorithms executed at compile-time, including concepts, type predicates, and
metafunctions (@see Concepts, type predicates, and metafunctions).

Other libraries may contain meta-programming utilities related to functions or
types defined in that library; this library is for "pure" meta-programming
utilities.

Currently, it contains the following:

- is_const_ref.h: concept that is true for types that are const ref.

## Concepts, type predicates, and metafunctions

We use the following terminology.

- metafunctions. A metafunction is like a "function" (in a broad sense) that
  takes a type as argument and returns a type. In C++ they are typically defined
  with `using` directives taking template arguments. Example:

  ```
  /// Value_type<X> equals X::value_type.
  template <class Container>
  using Value_type = typename Container::value_type;
  ```

- concepts, the C++20 feature. A concept is like a "function" that takes a type
  as argument and returns a boolean value. Example:

  ```
  /// Has_foo<X> is true if X has a nonstatic member foo that can be invoked.
  template <class Test>
  concept Has_foo = requires (Test test) { test.foo(); };
  ```

- type predicates. A type predicate is a struct that derives from
  std::integral_constant, and usually even std::bool_constant. Its purpose is
  the same as that of a concept: to take a type as argument and return a boolean
  value. See below for a comparison of the two tools. Example:

  ```
  /// Has_foo_predicate<X>::value is true if Has_foo<X> is true.
  template <class Test>
  struct Has_foo_predicate : public std::bool_constant<false> {};
  template <class Test>
    requires requires (Test test) { test.foo(); }
  struct Has_foo_predicate<Test> : public std::bool_constant<true> {};
  ```

### Choosing between concepts and type predicates

Although concepts and type predicates have exactly the same purpose, both these
tools are needed, because C++ puts different limitations on type predicates and
concepts:

- concepts, but not type predicates, are allowed in the following syntactic
  contexts:

  ```
  // constrained function parameter
  void f1(conceptname auto param);

  // constrained template arguments
  template <conceptname type>
  void f2();
  template <conceptname auto constant>
  void f3();

  // constraints on result types in requires expressions
  template <class T>
      requires (T obj) {
          { obj.f() } -> conceptname;
      }
  void f5();
  ```

- type predicates, but not concepts, can be passed as template arguments.
  Therefore, if a generic metafunction executes an algorithm, and a parameter of
  that algorithm is a function on types, then that parameter can be expressed as
  a type constraint, but not as a concept:

  ```
  // template parameter
  template <class first, class second, template <class> class predicate>
  concept both_match = predicate<first>::value && predicate<second>::value;
  ```
