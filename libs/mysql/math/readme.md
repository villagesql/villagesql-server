MySQL Math Library
==================

Code documentation: @ref GroupLibsMysqlMath.

This is a header-only library, containing mathematical functions. Currently it
has the following headers:

- bounded_arithmetic.h: multiplication and addition, capped at a max value.

- int_pow.h: Functions to compute powers and logarithms for integers
  efficiently:

  - `int_pow(a, b)` computes `a` to the power `b`.
    For constexpr arguments, reduces to a compile-time constant.
    Otherwise, logarithmic in the exponent. The exact number of multiplications
    is equal to the 2-logarithm of the exponent, plus the number of 1-bits in
    the exponent.

  - `int_log<N>(a)` computes the base-`N` logarithm of `a`. For constexpr
    arguments, reduces to a constant. Otherwise, logarithmic in the `base`
    logarithm of std::numeric_limits<Value_t>::max(). The exact number of
    divisions is the floor of `log2(int_log_max<Value_t, base>())` and in each
    division, the denominator is a compile-time constant which is a power of
    `base`, so that the compiler may use denominator-specific optimizations such
    as shift-right instead of division operations.

  - `int_log_max<T>()` reduces to a compile-time constant, which is the floor
    of the logarithm of the maximum value representable in type T.
